  RCommon is a cohesive set of libraries with abstractions for widely used
  implementations of design patterns which are common (see what we did there?)
  to many applications used today.

# Introduction

## Our Philosophy

We've worked on a lot of projects with a variety of needs. In some cases, we've been thrown into a legacy project whose design decisions were made long ago. Whether you are beginning the design phase of your project or need to introduce new design patterns to an old application, our philosophy with RCommon is that software engineers should have flexibility in their choices of implementations, and the freedom from being strapped to those choices forever. Furthermore, we believe that having flexibility and freedom in application architecture, should not come at great cost to time or monetary value when you choose to exercise flexibility or freedom at any point in the future based on changing needs.

**Quick Tip:** RCommon is configuration oriented which allows us to give you only what you need for your application. Before jumping into the samples, we recommend at least reading through the Fundamentals-> [Configuration ](topics/fundamentals/configuration.md)section.

### Jump Right In

Ok, we've got it...lets look at some code!

{% content-ref url="getting-started/running-examples.md" %}
[running-examples.md](getting-started/running-examples.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Dive a Little Deeper

{% content-ref url="topics/use-cases/" %}
[use-cases](topics/use-cases/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="topics/fundamentals/" %}
[fundamentals](topics/fundamentals/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="topics/infrastructure/" %}
[infrastructure](topics/infrastructure/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="topics/architecture/" %}
[architecture](topics/architecture/)
{% endcontent-ref %}



### License

{% hint style="info" %}
NOT LEGAL ADVICE: We're not lawyers but here is a little explainer about the Apache 2.0 license. The [Apache software license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) gives users permission to reuse code for nearly any purpose, including using the code as part of proprietary software. As with other [open source licenses](https://snyk.io/learn/open-source-licenses/), the Apache license governs how end-users can utilize the software in their own projects. The Apache license requires developers to disclose any major changes they make to the original source code. The modified source code does not need to be revealed, but a notice of the modification is required. However, any unmodified code must retain the Apache license.

### Credit

RCommon was originally born from the [NCommon](https://github.com/riteshrao/ncommon) project under the Apache 2.0 license. While you may still find some of the original code from that project, we have basically redesigned everything from the ground up. That said, thanks Ritesh Rao for the inspiration way back in 2008!
