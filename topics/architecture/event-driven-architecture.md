# Event Driven Architecture

## Overview

Event driven architecture is often paired with other architectural or cloud design patterns such as domain driven design (DDD), [microservices](microservices.md), event sourcing, or [clean architecture](clean-architecture.md). Generally, it infers the usage of high volume, real-time applications which may exist as several sub-systems which need to process data asynchronously in their own unique models. There are a great deal of benefits and challenges associated with this architecture. That said, we'll show you how RCommon trivializes some of the more complex mechanics of such a system should you decide to use it.
