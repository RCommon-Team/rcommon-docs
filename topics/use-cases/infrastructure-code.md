# Lack of Infrastructure Code

Development teams will often kick off a project without infrastructure code so they can move fast. Thinking you can deliver a project faster without infrastructure code is a fallacy. This is a pattern of behavior we see time and time again and more often than not, if original team members are still around, they regret the decision.&#x20;

Occasionally I run into teams that are already pretty far down the road building out an application without infrastructure code. The good news is that is it never too late to start using infrastructure libraries like RCommon to improve speed of delivery, testability, and deliver code that has a sound architecture.&#x20;
