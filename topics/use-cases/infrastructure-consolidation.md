  infrastructures at the same time!

# Infrastructure Consolidation

## Scenario

"Hey Jason, it's a long story but we use multiple database management systems, Azure for 'this', and AWS for 'that'. There is a plan to move to 'XYZ' long term but migrating will be difficult."

While we can't help with your infrastructure migration, RCommon can ensure that swapping out your infrastructure implementation in your code is a relatively simple task. RCommon utilizes abstractions of a variety of patterns so that developers write code against those abstractions rather than specific implementations. For example, switching from Azure Event Hub to AWS SNS/SQS is as easy as changing a few lines of configuration code...after you stand up the infrastructure, and migrate your existing data of course!&#x20;
