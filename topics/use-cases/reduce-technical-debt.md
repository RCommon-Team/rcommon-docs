# Reduce Technical Debt

### Questions First

* Do you or your team struggle writing loosely coupled code efficiently?
* Are you a startup that is struggling to properly design an application because of the "hurry up"?
* Has your application recently been audited and now you have an architectural heatmap to address?

Answering "yes" to any of these questions means you may have some substantial technical debt to pay down. This is where RCommon can help. Creating loosely coupled, object oriented code reduces your cost of ownership - and there is never a bad time to start.&#x20;
