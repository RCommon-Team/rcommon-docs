# Multiple Teams/Tooling

## Scenario

"Hey Jason, our team is simply to stuck in their ways of using 'this' library persistence and the other team prefers to use 'that' tool for persistence."

Great - this is where RCommon shines. If we can all agree to code against a common set of abstractions then everyone can continue using whatever libraries they want!&#x20;
