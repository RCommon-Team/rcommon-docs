# Emailing

Sending email is one of the most common pieces of infrastructure that modern applications need. RCommon provides a simple interface to give you everything you need to send email through an SMTP server or the SendGrid API.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="smtp-email.md" %}
[smtp-email.md](smtp-email.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="sendgrid-email-api.md" %}
[sendgrid-email-api.md](sendgrid-email-api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
