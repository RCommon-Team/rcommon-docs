# MassTransit

[MassTransit ](https://masstransit-project.com/)is a framework that abstracts away the complexities of messaging queues and distributed computing at large. It is used to some degree to implement the [Distributed Unit of Work ](broken-reference)and ultimately helps us walk up to distributed computing with RCommon.&#x20;

[MassTransit is very well documented](https://masstransit-project.com/) and well supported by the open source community.&#x20;
