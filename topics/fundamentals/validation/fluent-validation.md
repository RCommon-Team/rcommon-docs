# Fluent Validation

FluentValidation is a wonderful and popular library that has an extensible validation implementation which can easily speak for itself. It only made sense to implement some abstractions for validation in RCommon but you could easily say that the entire implementation is based FluentValidations foundations - if you know a better player in the game then put a PR together!
