# Logging

Logging is, as it has been since the advent of .NET Core, a first class citizen. As such, in order to effectively use RCommon, a logging factory must be implemented during the instantiation of the application. There are a variety of extensible logging libraries that can get the job done, or you can simple bootstrap your own for testing purposes.&#x20;
