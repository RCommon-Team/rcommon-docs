# Exception Handling Application Block (EHAB)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Beware that this library is no longer maintained in the open source community and will likely be removed in the near future. We plan on continuing the abstraction so your code is still safe, but we are looking at alternative implementations.&#x20;

[Let us know if you have ideas!](https://github.com/RCommon-Team/RCommon/discussions/64)
