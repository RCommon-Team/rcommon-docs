# 2.1.0

Version 2.1.0 is built exclusively on .NET 8 as .NET 6, and .NET 7 are at[ end of support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). This minor release was focused on decoupling caching and JSON serialization mechanisms from CQRS areas and adding abstractions for caching and JSON serialization/deserialization to the application services and persistence implementations.&#x20;



## Release Notes

* JSON Serialization (New)
  * Newtonsoft JSON.NET
  * System.Text.Json
  * Examples included
* Caching (New)
  * Redis/Valkey Caching
  * In Memory Caching
  * Examples included
* Persistence
  * Cached Queries (New)
  * Examples included

### Support

We will support this version as long as .NET 8 supports the dependency libraries.

### Breaking Changes

* Moved various DTO/Model objects from RCommon.ApplicationServices into the RCommon.Model namespace/package. These are namspace changes only.&#x20;
* DTOs in RCommon.Model were converted to record types to allow consistency with immutability standards. These are fundamental changes to the signature of the type, but the signature of the object itself has not changed.
