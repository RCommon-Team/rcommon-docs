# C# Method Extensions

## Use Case

Developers need utility libraries for everyday life. There are some [pretty comprehensive extension libraries out there for C#](https://github.com/zzzprojects/Z.ExtensionMethods) but we've managed to procure some useful stuff ourselves due to the needs of a large codebase. Bet you'll find something you need at some point.&#x20;
