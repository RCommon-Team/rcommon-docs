# Existing or Predefined Solution Architecture

## Use Case

So you got involved with a project that already has made certain decisions regarding its infrastructure. No big deal! RCommon doesn't take an all or nothing approach. Feel free to take some or none of it. One of the more common scenarios we encounter is many application frameworks require you to adopt their dependency injection tooling, their method of bootstrapping, and many layers infrastructure just to use a small slice of tooling. We prefer a more adaptive approach.&#x20;
