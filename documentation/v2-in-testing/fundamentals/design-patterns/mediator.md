# Mediator

[Mediatr ](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)is a first class citizen in RCommon. It is used extensively to decouple event handling and for [custom pipeline behaviors.](../../../../v1/infrastructure/mediatr-pipeline/) There is a great deal of [documentation about the mediator pattern ](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki)so we won't attempt to redefine it here.&#x20;
